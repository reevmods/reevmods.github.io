                        <h1>EU mediation</h1>
                        By the Regulation on Online Dispute Resolution in Consumer Affairs (ODR Regulation), we would like to inform you about the online dispute resolution platform (OS platform).
                        Consumers have the option of complaining to the European Commission's online dispute resolution platform at http://ec.europa.eu/odr?tid=321116009. The necessary contact details can be found above in our imprint.
                        
                        We would like to point out, however, that we are not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution procedures before a consumer arbitration board.

                        We have written this privacy policy (version 14.09.2019-321116009) to explain to you by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which information we collect, how we use data and what options you have as a visitor to this website,

                        <h1>Automatic data storage</h1>
                        When you visit websites today, certain information is automatically created and stored, including on this website.
                        
                        If you visit our website as it is now, our web server (computer on which this website is stored) automatically saves data such as
                        
                        the address (URL) of the website you are visiting
                        Browser and browser version
                        the operating system used
                        the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL)
                        the hostname and IP address of the device from which it is accessed
                        Date and Time
                        in files (web server log files).
                        <br><br>
                        As a rule, web server log files are stored for two weeks and then deleted automatically. We do not disclose this information, but we can not rule out that it will be seen in the event of unlawful behavior.
                        The legal basis, according to Article 6 paragraph 1 f DSGVO (lawfulness of processing), is that there is a legitimate interest in enabling the error-free operation of this website by capturing web server log files.
